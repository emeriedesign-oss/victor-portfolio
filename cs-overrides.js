      overview: "Nebula Protocol is a DeFi lending and borrowing dApp with a distinctive proposition: it accepts DEX LP tokens as collateral, letting liquidity providers unlock capital without exiting their positions. Powerful idea — but LP collateral is unfamiliar territory even for experienced DeFi users, and unfamiliarity in finance reads as risk.",
      problem: "Users understood lending and they understood liquidity provision — but the combination was new, and the interface did little to bridge the gap. Collateral health, liquidation thresholds and LP-token valuation were presented as raw numbers with no narrative, so users either over-collateralized out of fear or stayed away entirely.",
      research: [
        { t: "Unfamiliarity reads as risk", d: "In walkthroughs, users hesitated longest on screens explaining LP collateral — not because the math was hard, but because nothing confirmed their mental model was right." },
        { t: "Liquidation anxiety", d: "The single biggest fear was silent liquidation. Users wanted to know exactly how close they were to danger, in plain language, at all times." },
        { t: "Valuation opacity", d: "LP tokens are priced from pool reserves — a derivation users couldn't inspect. Black-box numbers undermined trust in the whole position." }
      ],
      insights: [
        { t: "Show the position, not just the number", d: "A health factor of 1.8 means nothing on its own. Framing it as distance-to-liquidation, visually, converts abstraction into instinct." },
        { t: "Teach inside the flow", d: "Users don't read docs before depositing. Contextual explanation at each decision point outperformed any standalone education." },
        { t: "Reversibility builds courage", d: "Clear paths to add collateral or partially repay made users comfortable borrowing closer to their actual capacity." }
      ],
      process: [
        { t: "Protocol & mental-model audit", d: "Mapped every concept the interface assumed against what target users actually knew." },
        { t: "Risk-legibility study", d: "Tested how users interpreted health factors, LTV ratios and liquidation prices across framings." },
        { t: "Flow design", d: "Designed deposit, borrow, and manage-position flows around progressive disclosure of risk." },
        { t: "Usability validation", d: "Validated with both DeFi-native and DeFi-curious participants." }
      ],
      strategy: "Make risk legible. Every position renders as a visual health gauge with plain-language framing — how much you've borrowed, what your collateral is worth, and exactly what has to happen before liquidation. LP-token valuation became inspectable, and every borrowing decision shows its effect on position health before confirmation.",
      solutions: "The shipped dApp leads with a position dashboard built around distance-to-liquidation, contextual explainers at each decision point, and previews that show the consequence of every action before it's signed. Lending depth stayed; the dread didn't.",
      metrics: null,
      learnings: "DeFi UX is risk communication. The protocol's mechanics were sound from day one — what needed design was the user's confidence that they understood their own position. Legibility, not simplification, was the unlock.",
      reflection: "We didn't dumb down the protocol. We made its risks honest and visible, and that honesty is what made users comfortable enough to use it.",
      quote: "Nebula finally feels as trustworthy as the math behind it."
